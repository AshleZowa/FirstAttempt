            <h1>Photography, <br><span>a world where</span><br>moments captured last forever.</h1>
            <p class="par">Hi, my name is Ashley and I'm a photographer. My passion for art began at an early age of 6 when I attended an art exhibition with my family. 
                <br>I knew at that moment that my calling was in art. After high school, I attended the Johannesburg School of Arts, where I majored in photography. When I graduated,
                5 years ago, I decided to be a freelance photographer. It has been an eventful experience that has made me who I am today. <br> Last year
                I started my own business and brand, World Of Photography and now the sky is the limit. Photography is my one true  
                <br>love and my goal is to take you with me on this journey as we capture memorable moments that will last forever. </p>
